# FeedFetch
A lightweight, dependency-free RSS and Atom reader for web servers.
Written in pure Perl, FeedFetch retrieves and formats feeds server-side into compact, styled HTML suitable for embedding on static sites or dashboards.
It supports HTTP/HTTPS feeds, basic redirects, and customizable layout via a configuration section.
No JavaScript, no external proxies â€” just fast, self-hosted feed headlines.
